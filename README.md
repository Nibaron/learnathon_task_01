# ReactJS API Project

This is a simple ReactJS project that fetches and displays data from a REST API. The project allows users to interact with data from one of the following APIs:

1. [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)
2. [SpaceX Data API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)
3. [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## Features

1. **Basic Folder Structure:** The project follows a basic folder structure to organize components and styles.

2. **Data Fetching:** The application fetches data from the selected API using Axios.

3. **Show Data Results:** Fetched data is displayed in the user interface.

4. **Error and Loading States:** The UI displays appropriate states for errors and loading while fetching data.

5. **Dropdown Filter:** Users can filter data using a simple dropdown. The displayed data is based on the selected value; if no value is set, all data is shown.

6. **CSS Styling:** The components are styled using CSS without any additional libraries.
